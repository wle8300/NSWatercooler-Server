non-intuitive aspects of the api

[GET/article & GET/feed] As an id, you can always choose between the sha1/url. Whenever you use an url, it will apply sha1@npm to interpolate an id.


Feed
{
	favicon: <url>,
	id: <sha1 of canon of url>,
	name: 'asdf',
	url: <canon of request.payload.url> 
}

Article
{
	archiveDate: <Date>,
	date: <Date>,
	url: <canon of this.link>,
	id: <sha1 of canon of this.link>,
	feed: <feed.id>,
	[...and other meta from feed-parser]
}

# Feed

## Adding a new feed to pubcenter

POST https://pub.center/feed {feed: http://cnn.com/feed.xml}

You can also post FeedBurner urls. Those work fine


## Getting a feed

GET https://pub.center/feed/http://cnn.com/feed.xml

There's useful information here like:
a) when it was last updated
b) the favicon image
c) the rss url
d) etc


# Article

## to get a feed's articles:

https://pub.center/feed/http://cnn.com/feed.xml/articles
https://pub.center/feed/http%3A%2F%2Fcnn.com%2Ffeed.xml/articles
https://pub.center/feed/86af20c6e5e16bc3227aa99a4c33e6d24ecc0180e9/articles
https://pub.center/article?feed=http://cnn.com/feed.xml
https://pub.center/article?feed=86af20c6e5e16bc3227aa99a4c33e6d24ecc0180e9

by default it'll limit to 10 articles. you can change this by using some optional queries like

"limit"

"page"

for example: https://pub.center/feed/http://cnn.com/feed.xml/articles?page=14&limit=30

the maximum you can "limit" is 100 articles per request.

## Get a single article

Just append the permalink. example:

https://pub.center/article/http://cnn.com/wolf-blitzer-got-super-blitzed
https://pub.center/article/http%3A%2F%2Fcnn.com%2Fwolf-blitzer-got-super-blitzed
https://pub.center/article/86a3b2d9655de6b76e78d6aa5c79178e3899a5b43d

This is nice when you have already have the link for an article, and you want to get the rss-ified version of it. Just append it and boom.

### Caveat

If the permalink has a hash anchor or query string in it... you don't have an option, you must use `encodeURIComponent()` to encode it. example:

to get this saved article on pubcenter: https://dribbble.com/shots/2748440-Super-Deluxe-Clinton-West-2016#comment-5314090

encode it like so: https://pub.center/article/https%3A%2F%2Fdribbble.com%2Fshots%2F2748440-Super-Deluxe-Clinton-West-2016%23comment-5314090
