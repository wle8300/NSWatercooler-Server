# gotchas

the DBG api considers:
- "characters" in "outfits" as "members." it's just characters... don't use "members" as a variable!
- outfit "leader" as the founder. this contradicts the "leader" member rank; a tier of outfit membership which can be many other characters of the outfit

# value
- social, community building, chatting, letting people represent (flaunting their pride)
- cultivating healthy competition between outfits
- encouraging the recruitment and retention of fresh planetman's to The Game
- gain tangible/intangible goods

## tangible goods
- tangible goods individual/group, e.g., cold hard cash, swag (clothing, stickers, patches),
- individual intangible value, e.g., preferred loadouts, best class performance, statistics, booty passed down from outfit leader, tactile/response time improvement, decision making
- group intangible value, e.g., street credz to flaunt

# ways to generate revenue
- monthly fees for outfits ~35/month
- monthly fees for characters to use scheduler and other unlocked features ~3/month
- sell merchandise (vinyl toys, tshirts, stickers, patches, hoodies)
- get the ear of Andy Sites and Wrel and give bug reports, feature requests

# outfit benefits
- paid-for fees to start a local MeetupÂ®, $35 stipend/month for food & drinks
